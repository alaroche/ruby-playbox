Here's how it works:  I travel the stormy Internets and find cool Ruby puzzles/challenges that I think might be fun to solve.  I do the heavy lifting and post my solutions to this repository.

RSpec tests are recommended.. no.. they're required.  This is serious business, but in a fun way, which is what this repository is all about.
